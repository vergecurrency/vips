**Abstract**

This proposal outlines the implementation of ISO20022 in Verge Currency's application layer to facilitate easy adoption for transactions using XVG. The proposed enhancements aim to improve scalability, adoption, and ease of use for institutions using XVG as an alternative payment, providing security and speed for ISO20022 transactions. ISO20022 is a global standard for financial messaging that enables efficient and secure communication between financial institutions. It provides a common language and syntax (XML) for this messaging system and facilitates interoperability between different payment systems.

**Motivation**

Verge Currency needs application support for ISO20022 compliance to enable banks and exchanges to easily adopt XVG for transactions. The proposed implementation will not change Verge Currency's native blockchain, but will enhance scalability, adoption, and ease of use for institutions to use XVG as an alternative payment.

Overall, ISO 20022 compliance would provide Verge with a range of benefits that could help to enhance its adoption and value proposition, making it a more attractive and competitive cryptocurrency option.

**Specification**

The proposed logo is:

The proposed logo for app icons and recognition is:

The proposed interface will be written in Dart. Propsed design would be:

The proposed implementation will provide application support for ISO20022 in Verge Currency's application layer. This will involve the following standards:

[standards of implementation]

The standard will follow the guidelines set out in [ISO20022.org](https://www.iso20022.org/)

**Rationale**

By being ISO 20022 compliant, Verge benefits from a higher level of data standardization and increased automation in financial transactions. This would result in a fast and reliable payment system for financial institutions. Additionally, it would allow for greater interoperability with other payment systems, expanding the use case for Verge and increasing its overall utility.

**Backwards Compatibility**

No implementation of ISO20022 at this time would require any backwards compatibility, however, future implementations may require backwards compatibility and all tests here forward MUST pass all tests prior to merging any commits to the upstream branch
