## What is a VIP?

VIP stands for Verge Improvement Proposal. A VIP is a design document providing information to the Verge community, or describing a new feature for Verge or its processes or environment. The VIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We intend VIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Verge. The VIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the VIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

## VIP Types

There are three kinds of VIPs:

- A **Standards Track VIP** describes any change that affects most or all Verge implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Verge.
- An **Informational VIP** describes a Verge design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Verge community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational VIPs do not necessarily represent a Verge community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore Informational VIPs or follow their advice.
- A **Process VIP** describes a process surrounding Verge, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process VIPs are like Standards Track VIPs but apply to areas other than the Verge protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Verge's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational VIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Verge development. Any meta-VIP is also considered a Process VIP.

## VIP Work Flow

The VIP process begins with a new idea for Verge. Each potential VIP must have a champion -- someone who writes the VIP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The VIP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is VIP-able. Posting to the [developers](mailto:developers@vergecurrency.com) mailing list (and maybe the [Discord](https://discord.gg/vergecurrency) or [Telegram](https://t.me/VERGExvg) related forums) is the best way to go about this.

**Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a VIP is meant to save both the potential author and the wider community time**. Many ideas have been brought forward for changing Verge that have been rejected for various reasons. Asking the Verge community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where Verge is used. Small enhancements or patches often don't need standardisation between multiple projects; these don't need a VIP and should be injected into the relevant Verge development work flow with a patch submission to the applicable Verge issue tracker.

Once the champion has asked the Verge community as to whether an idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft VIP should be presented to the [developers](mailto:developers@vergecurrency.com). This gives the author a chance to create the draft VIP to make it properly formatted, of high quality, and to address additional concerns about the proposal. Following a discussion, the proposal should be sent to the Verge-dev list and the VIP editor with the draft VIP. This draft must be written in VIP style as described below, or else it will be sent back without further regard until proper formatting rules are followed.

VIP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on both the initial idea and the VIP before submitting it for review. However, wherever possible, **long open-ended discussions on public mailing lists should be avoided**. Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include: setting up a separate SIG mailing list for the topic, having the VIP author accept private comments in the early design phases, setting up a wiki page or git repository, etc. VIP authors should use their discretion here.

It is highly recommended that a single VIP contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the VIP, the more successful it tends to be. If in doubt, split your VIP into several well-focused ones.

The VIP editors assign VIP numbers and change their status. Please send all VIP-related email to the VIP editor, which is listed under VIP Editors below. Also see VIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow. The VIP editor reserves the right to reject VIP proposals if they appear too unfocused or too broad.

Authors **MUST NOT** self assign VIP numbers, but should use an alias such as "VIP-johndoe-infiniteVerges" which includes the author's name/nick and the VIP subject.

If the VIP editor approves, he will assign the VIP a number, label it as Standards Track, Informational, or Process, give it status "Draft", and add it to the VIPs git repository. The VIP editor will not unreasonably deny a VIP. Reasons for denying VIP status include duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with the **Verge philosophy**. For a VIP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly.

The VIP author may update the Draft as necessary in the git repository. Updates to drafts may also be submitted by the author as pull requests.

Standards Track VIPs consist of two parts, a design document and a reference implementation. The VIP should be reviewed and accepted before a reference implementation is begun, unless a reference implementation will aid people in studying the VIP. Standards Track VIPs must include an implementation -- in the form of code, a patch, or a URL to same -- before it can be considered Final.

Once a VIP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be completed. When the reference implementation is complete and accepted by the community, the status will be changed to "Final".

A VIP can also be assigned status "Deferred". The VIP author or editor can assign the VIP this status when no progress is being made on the VIP. Once a VIP is deferred, the VIP editor can re-assign it to draft status.

A VIP can also be "Rejected". Perhaps after all is said and done it was not a good idea. It is still important to have a record of this fact.

VIPs can also be superseded by a different VIP, rendering the original obsolete. This is intended for Informational VIPs, where version 2 of an API can replace version 1.

The possible paths of the status of VIPs are as follows:

Some Informational and Process VIPs may also have a status of "Active" if they are never meant to be completed. E.g. VIP 1 (this VIP).

## What belongs in a successful VIP?

Each VIP should have the following parts:

- Preamble -- RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the VIP, including the VIP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the contact info for each author, etc.

- Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

- Copyright/public domain -- Each VIP must either be explicitly labelled as placed in the public domain (see this VIP as an example) or licensed under the Open Publication License.

- Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Verge platforms.

- Motivation -- The motivation is critical for VIPs that want to change the Verge protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the VIP solves. VIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

- Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

- The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

- Backwards Compatibility -- All VIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The VIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. VIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

- Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be completed before any VIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the VIP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before writing code.

- The final implementation must include test code and documentation appropriate for the Verge protocol.

## VIP Formats and Templates

VIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown format.

## VIP Header Preamble

Each VIP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with "\*" are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

<pre>
  VIP: <VIP number>
  Title: <VIP title>
  Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addrs>
* Discussions-To: <email address>
  Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
           Withdrawn | Final | Superseded>
  Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
  Created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>
* Post-History: <dates of postings to Verge mailing list>
* Replaces: <VIP number>
* Superseded-By: <VIP number>
* Resolution: <url>
</pre>

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses of all the authors/owners of the VIP. The format of the Author header value must be

Random J. User <address@dom.ain>

if the email address is included, and just

Random J. User

if the address is not given.

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.

Note: The Resolution header is required for Standards Track VIPs only. It contains a URL that should point to an email message or other web resource where the pronouncement about the VIP is made.

While a VIP is in private discussions (usually during the initial Draft phase), a Discussions-To header will indicate the mailing list or URL where the VIP is being discussed. No Discussions-To header is necessary if the VIP is being discussed privately with the author, or on the Verge email mailing lists.

The Type header specifies the type of VIP: Standards Track, Informational, or Process.

The Created header records the date that the VIP was assigned a number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of when new versions of the VIP are posted to Verge mailing lists. Both headers should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.

VIPs may have a Requires header, indicating the VIP numbers that this VIP depends on.

VIPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that a VIP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the VIP that replaces the current document. The newer VIP must have a Replaces header containing the number of the VIP that it rendered obsolete.

## Auxiliary Files

VIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Image files should be included in a subdirectory for that VIP. Auxiliary files must be named VIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where "XXXX" is the VIP number, "Y" is a serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. "png").

## Transferring VIP Ownership

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of VIPs to a new champion. In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred VIP, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the VIP process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the VIP. We try to build consensus around a VIP, but if that's not possible, you can always submit a competing VIP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a VIP, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the VIP editor. If the original author doesn't respond to email in a timely manner, the VIP editor will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :) ).

## VIP Editors

The current VIP editors are [Verge Developers](mailto:developers@vergecurrency.com).

## VIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow

The VIP editor subscribes to the Verge development mailing list. All VIP-related correspondence should be sent (or CC'd) to developers@vergecurrency.com.

For each new VIP that comes in an editor does the following:

- Read the VIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be accepted.
- The title should accurately describe the content.
- Edit the VIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (for reST VIPs), code style.

If the VIP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the VIP is ready for the repository it should be submitted as a pull request to the [Verge Repository](https://github.com/vergecurrency/verge) repository on GitHub where it may get further feedback.

The VIP editor will:

- Assign a VIP number (almost always just the next available number) in the pull request comments.

- Merge the pull request when the author is ready (allowing some time for further peer review).

- List the VIP in [README](../README.md)

- Send email back to the VIP author with next steps (post to Verge-dev mailing list).

The VIP editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial responsibilities. The VIP editors monitor VIP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.

## History

This document was derived heavily from Bitcoin's BIP procecss which derived heavily from Python's PEP-0001. In many places text was simply copied and modified. Although the PEP-0001 text was written by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger, and the text for Bitcoin BIPs was written by many talented Bitcoin developers, they are **not responsible** for its use in the Verge Improvement Process, and **should not** be bothered with technical questions specific to Verge or the VIP process. Please direct all comments to the VIP editors or the Verge development mailing list.

## Changelog

23 Jan 2023 - Using the basic Bitcoin workflow and the documents provided on [Bitcoin BIPs repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips), the document was copied and modified to Verge specific needs. (This is a rough draft)
